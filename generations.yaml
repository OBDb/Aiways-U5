    description: "The Aiways U5 is the first production model from Chinese electric vehicle startup Aiways. This all-electric compact SUV features a 63 kWh battery pack delivering approximately 400 km (250 miles) of range on the WLTP cycle. Powered by a single electric motor producing 150 kW (201 HP) and 315 Nm of torque, the U5 combines modern styling with practical interior space and contemporary technology. It was one of the first Chinese-made electric vehicles to be widely exported to European markets, beginning in 2020. The U5 features a minimalist interior with a large central touchscreen, advanced driver assistance systems, and fast-charging capability that can replenish the battery from 30% to 80% in around 30 minutes."
